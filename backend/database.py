This file provides functions for opening and closing a database connection. The purpose of this file is to allow for easy use of FastAPI lifestyle events to open a database connection on API startup and close the connection on API shutdown rather than opening and closing a database connectiaon with every API request.

Go to the following link for information about the PostgreSQL connection string, which is the single argument that's used in the connect() call below:

  Make the changes to the database persistent and close database connection on API shutdown.
